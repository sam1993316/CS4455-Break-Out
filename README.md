Instructions:
WASD to move the character. Space Bar to jump. Press E to pick up collectibles like bottles and key cards. 
Once the player has picked up a bottle, they can throw it by pressing left-click to create a noise that attracts
nearby enemies. 

Goal of the game: 
Escape the prison without being caught by the guards. If the player is spotted by a guard,
the guard will begin to chase them. If a guard catches the player, the player loses. The player wins if they
manage to make it to the end of the level without being caught. 

Technology Requirements:
AI: The guards patrol certain areas, and they will chase the player if they spot the player.
Interable-able physics: The player can pick up and throw bottles to distract enemies.
Character animation: The player character uses blended animations between idle/running/jumping.
Audio: When the player moves, footsteps sounds are played. When the player throws a bottle, a glass-breaking
sound is played when the bottle collides with the environment. 
Interesting choices: There a number of different paths the player can take to reach the end of the level.
